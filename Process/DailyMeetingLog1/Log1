Ming Han design a page that is allowed staff to view the ordered food list so that the staff can review and double confirm the order.

Today Ming Han is going to design the list of orederd item in the page and coding the calculation.

Ming Han faced some logic error during the calculation of total order price. I suggested him to check on the variable that use to 
calculate the total price whether all the ordered item has included or not.
