What I did yesterday:
I have designed a page that allow admin to add new stock to the database.

What I am doing today:
I am going to test the designed form with textbox, drop down list and so on to prevent admin to enter invalid value for every stock details accordingly.

What is blocking me:
Some error handling format which is quite complicated that I need more time to figure it out by searching online.
